vimnote the beginnings of a clone of Gnote (a note taking application like
Tomboy). Except, of course, in each small window there is all of Vim inside.

This is just the beginnings after some hours of hacking. It supports much of
the same D-Bus API, so that it already can be used by Kupfer's Notes plugin,
which normally works with Gnote or Tomboy.

Invoke it using::

    python vimnote.py

Envisioned features are the basics of Gnote: Spatial windows (remembering
size and position), and then we want some vim customization too and better
Kupfer integration.
